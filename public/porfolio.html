      <p>Hello, I'm a 20 year old Miami native, who grew up in Wynwood. During my teenage years i noticed i always sided with my tech-savy mentors and was amazed at the pace technology was moving and how relevant the tech scene was emerging and becoming a part of everyday life. It was the coolest thing as a kid witnessing it all go from the chalk board era to powerpoints; to now all the AI technology which is slightly creepy but mind-blowing. I was introduced to Wyncode Academy from my close friend Annette Aristide about a Web development course and took it. Ever since then, i felt like i have been learning such a valuable skill set. I plan to teach myself back-end to gradually become a Full-stack Web Developer.Thankfully, as a developer i will channel all my creativity and strive to be an active member of the tech community because i am woman in tech! Just like a needle in a haystack. I am a total optimist so i believe possiblities are endless and your capabilities are really in your own hands it's up to yourself to challenge yourself.</p>

        <p>As for what drives me, i would say my hunger to be successful. I'm a mother so i know that everything i do is being watched by my son. I also want to be able to give him everything finiacially and if i can alter his future for the better with tech i will! However, why stop there? As a developer i want to change peoples lives by hearing their problems and solving them by developing something that makes life easier. I want to be an active member of my tech community and make a difference.</p>
